# Hide Product Category Archives

Adds a per-product-category checkbox in WooCommerce that redirects visitors away from that product category archive to the Shop page, while keeping products visible via other categories, search, and facets.

## Features
- Checkbox on Products → Categories (add/edit)
- “Hidden archive” column on category list with one-click toggle
- 301 redirect for hidden product category archives
- Safe with FacetWP + Elementor (does not alter product visibility)
- Uninstall cleanup included

## Usage
1. Activate the plugin
2. Go to Products → Categories
3. Edit a category
4. Check “Hide category archive (redirect to Shop)”
5. Save

## Notes
- Redirect target is the WooCommerce Shop page.
- This does **not** remove products from the catalog.
- If a category is hidden, its archive URL redirects, including paginated archives.
